<h2>ðŸŽ¯ Project Aim</h2>
<p>
    This project focuses on sentiment analysis using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). 
    The goal is to classify human emotions such as happy, sad, and angry based on images. 
    By training a deep learning model on facial expressions, we aim to create an automated emotion detection system.
</p>

<h2>ðŸ§  Understanding CNN</h2>
<p>
    A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a specialized deep learning model designed for image recognition tasks. 
    It uses convolutional layers to extract features from images, pooling layers to reduce dimensions, 
    and fully connected layers to make predictions. In this project, CNN learns patterns in facial expressions 
    to classify emotions effectively.

<h2>ðŸ“‚ Dataset Description</h2>
<p>
    The dataset consists of labeled images representing different emotions. 
    Each image corresponds to a specific category like:
</p>
<ul>
    <li> Happy</li>
    <li>Sad</li>
    <li> Angry</li>
    <li>Disgust</li>
    <li>Fear</li>
    <li>neutral</li>
    <li>Suprise</li>
</ul>
<p>
    These images are preprocessed and used for training and testing the model.
